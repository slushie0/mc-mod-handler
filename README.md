# MC Mod Handler

MC Mod Handler is an Electron app designed to make it easier and faster to handle and update your mods without an ugly or slow launcher or app.

## Installation (For most people)

Download and extract the latest .zip download from the [releases](https://github.com/slushie0/mc-mod-handler/releases) section.

Run `mc-mod-handler.exe`

## Installation (For developers)
Clone the repo with your preferred method, then download the necessary npm packages. Run with `npm run dev`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slushie0/mc-mod-handler.git
cd mc-mod-handler
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Building
Currently it only supports windows, I have no idea how or if it will function on other platforms

```bash
npm run package-win
```

This will create a `release-builds` folder containing the built app

## Usage

The app is fairly intuitive, open an issue or DM me on [discord](https://www.discord.com/users/542493666296594473/) if something isn't working.
